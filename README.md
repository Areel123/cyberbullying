This is my internship project, I have developed a cyberbullying detection model and a Streamlit web app to classify messages as cyberbullying or not and identify the type of cyberbullying. I began by preprocessing the data, including tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, and lemmatization. Using TfidfVectorizer, I transformed the text data into numerical form and trained various machine learning models, selecting LinearSVC for its performance. After fine-tuning the model with GridSearchCV, I achieved high accuracy and F1 scores. I then built a Streamlit app where users can input messages and receive real-time classification results. This project enhanced my skills in natural language processing, machine learning, and web app development, resulting in a tool to help mitigate cyberbullying.
